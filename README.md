# Pathfinder Simulation
This is a project I made after finding out about Pathfinding Algorithms usinng my limited knowledge in Python. I tried to simulate an oversimplified A* Algorithm on a 2D grid. For a lack of a better visualization technique under my belt, each step of the process is printed out in the terminal.

will make updates
